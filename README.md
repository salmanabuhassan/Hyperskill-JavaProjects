# Hyperskill-JavaProjects
Familiarising myself with Java language. 
Implementing simple project along the way through Jetbrain Academy/Hyperskill platform.

Due to the COVID 19 event, IIUM decided to postpone the semester to 1 June 2020. 
Meanwhile, after getting internship offer for Application Engineer(Java), having
quite a long holiday before coming back to the university, I decided to make 
simple projects in Java for the purpose of learning development in it and OOP concept.

Info regarding projects
